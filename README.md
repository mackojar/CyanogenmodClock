# CyanogenmodClock
This is DeskClock application (standard CM11 clock app) ported from Cyanogenmod 11 stable branch to Sony branded Android 4.4.4.
It has removed some profiles support and has some minor code modification required to compile successfully.
It features alarm increasing volume and radial time picker (the application also includes CM11 datetimepicker module).

I couldn't find the alarm increasing volume feature in the original Android version of DeskClock application, so I chose to use CM version.

I wanted to do as few code modification, as needed, so there is still a few lint errors, 
which I belive can also be found in the original CM 11 stable code.

The code was compiled using Eclipse ADT.

Currently tested on Sony Xperia Compact Z1.
I believe it should work on any branded Android 4.4 which has wonderful, original Android clock application removed.
