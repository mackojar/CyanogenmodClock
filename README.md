# CyanogenmodClock
This is DeskClock application (standard CM11 clock app) ported from Cyanogenmod 11 stable branch to Android 4.4.4.
It has removed some profiles support and has some minor code modification required to compile successfully.

I wanted to do as few code modification, as needed, so there is still a few lint errors, 
which I belive can also be found in the original CM 11 stable code.

The application also includes CM11 datetimepicker module.

The code was compiled using Eclipse ADT.

Currently tested on Sony Xperia Compact Z1.
